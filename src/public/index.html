    <h1>Looking to explore the area?</h1>
    <p>Look, we know that for some, weddings can be an excuse to travel! Luckily, Princeton, NJ is pretty well situated</p>



    <h2>New York City</h2>

    <p>Princeton is about 1 hour away from the Big apple! If you're not from around here, definitely <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/New_York_City">consider spending some time </a> </p>

    <h2>Philadelphia</h2>
    <img src="https://lonelyplanetwp.imgix.net/2017/02/B.-Krist-VISIT-PHILADELPHIA_1-76f24f3e2dee.jpg?crop=entropy&fit=crop&h=421&sharp=10&vib=20&w=748"  style="height: 20vh" title="I'm obliged to not like Philly because my brother lived there, but it is the city of Brotherly love">
    <p>Princeton is also 1 hour away from Philly. I know many of you have lived in/know New York City quite well, so why not give <a href="https://wikitravel.org/en/Philadelphia">Philly a try?</a> </p>
    <h2>Altantic City</h2>

    <p>Atlantic City is also about 1 hour away, and makes a fantastic day trip in NJ</p>
    <h2>Princeton</h2>

    <p>You know we're cute, but do you know how we got together?</p>

    <h3>Sam</h3>
    <p>After college (and a brief stint in a PhD program) Sam, a young american-born confused desi boy in search of the deeper meaning of life (and some good food) joined the US Peace Corps, which sent him to México.</p>
    <img src="img/charro.jpg" title="My poor parents were already worried about how Americanized I was, and then I do this" style="height: 45vh">


    <h3>Nadia</h3>

    <p>A small town girl from Mexico, fresh from a Master's degree in linguistics, took a part-time job as a Spanish teacher, which brought her to the offices of the Peace Corps, to teach Spanish to new Peace Corps volunteers</p>

    <img src="img/nadia.jpg" style="height: 30vh" title="Guapa :*">

   <h3>Rule #1</h3>

    <p>   "Don't date the Spanish teacher"</p>

    <img src="img/us_3.jpg" style="height: 30vh" title="Seriously though Peace Corps, please don't be mad">

    <p>Whoops</p>

    <h3>5 years later..</h3>

    <img src="img/proposal.jpg" style="height: 50vh" title="The first time I proposed, the ring slipped out of my hands and rolled into the Taj Mahal fountains. I almost got arrested that day trying to fish the ring out of the fountains, but I'm glad I didn't get arrested. Getting engaged is way better">

<div class="panel" ng-show="selected=='gifts'">

    <h1>Don’t buy us boxed gifts! </h1>
    <p> If you’re coming to our wedding, that means you are an important part of our lives (and we hope we are of yours!). Sometimes people wish to show their appreciation at weddings by buying the wedding couple a gift - <b>but please don’t buy us boxed gifts</b>!  We would much rather that you just come and celebrate our special day with us.
    </p>

    <h3>Why no boxed gifts?</h3>
    <p>Nadia and Sam are <b>moving to Nigeria</b> shortly after our wedding. As of June 12th, 2018,  all of our worldly possessions will be packaged into 4 suitcases, and checked into the Mexico City airport, to be sent off to Africa.
        </p>

    <h3>Why are Sam and Nadia moving to Nigeria?</h3>
    <p>
    Sam is running <a href="http://www.dotlearn.org" style=" font-weight: bold;">dot Learn</a> , an education technology company/social enterprise that he co-founded to provide data-light online courses to students in Africa.
